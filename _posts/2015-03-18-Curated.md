<p>There are many different restaurant web-sites. But very 
few of them grab the attention of the user. In this article we will see 
the top 6 restaurant web sites based on their styling. </p>

<h4>[Visit Web-Site]( http://www.pizzerianapolicentrale.ro/)</h4>

You can easily tell when the header is over when the body starts and where the footer starts. Also the simple colors are perfectly used and it looks very similar to the actual restaurant.

They wanted me to see them and they succeeded in a very elegant and tricky way,
