<h1>The 6 best style wise restaurant web sites </h1>

<p>There are many different restaurant web-sites. But very 
few of them grab the attention of the user. In this article we will see 
the top 6 restaurant web sites based on their styling. </p>


<h3>1.Napoli Centrale</h3>
<h4>[VISIT NOW]</h4>( http://pizzerianapolicentrale.ro/)

<p>We believe that this web site serves its goals perfectly. It has a very clean look making the navigation very easy. It has been divided perfectly into segments. You can easily tell when the header is over when the body starts and where the footer starts. Also the simple colors are perfectly used and it looks very similar to the actual restaurant.

<h3>2.La porte Sainte Claire</h3>
<h4>[Visit Web-Site]( http://www.porte-sainte-claire.com/)</h4>
<p>This is probably the most unique website of the least. The restaurant is located in france so the main and only language is french. But this docent stand as a barrier to enter to web site since its 
very interesting to browse around and check out this menu.Its not necessarily pretty but its interesting to see what happens when you go with something that is moving  The color grid is very similar to the style of the restaurant  serving it perfectly.

<h3>3.Smokey Bones</h3>
<h4>[Visit Web-Site]( http://www.smokeybones.com/)</h4>
<p>This is my favorite one. I believe that it serves perfectly the actual restaurant. Its a very playful site with many warm colors that makes you wanna go there and have a great time. The simplicity that they kept is very useful since they can present whatever they want in a way that the customer will for sure see it. For example in the first page the slide show dominates the page something that means you can update it very easily and with a great response if done correctly. As a fist time user the first thing that i saw are the deals that they are offering today. 
They wanted me to see them and they succeeded in a very elegant and tricky way,

One of the biggest problems of web designers is to fit all the content in a way that is fully accessible and easy reachable without feeling that the page is heavy. The smooth light colors helped him succeed that
