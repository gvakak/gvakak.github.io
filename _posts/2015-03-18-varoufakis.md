<h1> Varoufakis And The Talkers</h1>

<p>The past 7 years Greece has been under recession. The unemployment rate has grown to 32 %.. The middle class has shrinked, the average person is working in order to feed his family and not buy extra goods. Minimum wage is at 300 euros per month. </p>
	<p>After 7 years, the greek people decided to elect a new left political party that promises them the old good times. Varoufakis is the second in power and prime minister of economics department. Because of his very important position the spotlight of fame has turned on him. </p>
<p>	In such a difficult period, this is probably the most important position of the government. You are managing the lives of 10 million people. By giving all day interviews and try to educate the world this government will fail terrible. And the thing is that if it fails now, there is no second chance. It is over.</p>
<p>	Going on, by giving many interviews it is very easy your words to be twisted. If someone gives in average 10 interviews a day, it is very difficult for someone else to keep up with what he is saying and many times people get confused and problems are created because of false information.</p>
  <p>   Even if he could educate the hole world and convince them that they are following wrong policies and everybody should follow the greeks. To give you an example, the campaign of siriza before the elections was lets change together Europe. </p>
<p>	How it is even possible to have people listen to you without gaining their respect. I can’t understand how he expects everyone to follow him because he has a degree in Economics. Everybody is good talking about theories. The person that goes the step further is the one that will take this theories and adopt them in real life. There we will be able to see if he is true or not.</p>
<p>	To conclude, this is probably the worst government that has ever passed from Greece. Not because they are lefties, Because they are talkers and not dowers. Greece is in the edge of the cliff and everything looks that it won’t survive it.</p>
