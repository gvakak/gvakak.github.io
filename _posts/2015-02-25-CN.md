---

<h2> The company </h2>
Casa Natura is a new player in the 100% natural health care products. 
They are a new American Company that focuses only selling environmentally friendly 
products that are made from natural, non-toxic ingredients.

<h3> Trying it out </h3>

Everything sounded perfect so far, but it was time to try the actual product. Out of a big selection we decided to try out the floor cleaner. The floor cleaner market is a very competitive market. There are huge players with huge revenues. We can say that there is an oligopoly.
Casa Natura Floor Cleaner comes in three different scents. Gardenia, pine, lavender. The product comes only in a certain size of 33.8 fl oz and in the very cheap price of 3.89$.
Before testing the product all of us thought that it won’t work like the toxic ones. We believed that the non harmful ingredients wouldn’t do the job. So we tried it on a wooden floor and the results were astonishing.
All of as were shocked on how such an environmentally friendly product could do such a perfect job without the negative effects of a normal floor cleaner. 
This product is perfect for everyone. You can use it as kids play around in the house, Its non-alergic, it dosent harm the environment after using it. Meaning the lakes and seas.
