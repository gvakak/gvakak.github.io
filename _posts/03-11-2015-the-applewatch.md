<h2> The Keynote </h2>
  <p>Time has arrived people, the Apple watch is here and ready to ship. On march 8 of 2015 Tim Cook the SEO 
of Apple Inc presented the new Apple watch at the annual keynote. It was a conference that included different 
speakers from different fields all over the industry.We were there in order to let you 
know about all the new tech that is coming soon.</p>
	<p>The conference started with a presentation of the new 
flagship store in China. This was big, because apple is trying for the 
past several years to enter the 2nd biggest market of the world. Going on, they presented the new 
software updates and the different fields that they will enter in the future.</p>

<h3> The Apple Watch </h3>

<p> The main focus of keynote was the apple watch. It was the last product presented. 
'Keep the best for lastâ€™. This is the first wearable technology that apple creates and it is believes 
that it will change the industry.</p>
<p> Apple was always about the software compared to all other big players.
They have realized that the average technology user dosent care about the hardware as long as
it works fluently.He wants something easy and comprehendible. We constantly listen from Dell and Microsoft 
about new monster machines with spectacular specs with endless possibilities.This machines are perfect for 
a business and not for individuals. </p>
<p> To make a long story short, there are similar products like the apple watch, probably with better specs. 
But none of them has  skyrocketed  with sales because the software and user experience is just not there.
Apple has promised allot of new futures that will make this product unbeatable and the experience unique.
