title: Economic Crisis in Greece

<h1>Greece about to take some decisions</h1>


<h2>Is it all about to end?</h2>


<p>  Greece is undergoing an economic recession for the past 5 years. Corruption and wrong decisions have 
led Greece in a very bad situation. With 30 % unemployment and minimum wage/pensions going down constantly 
the greek people revolutionized and elected a left government for the first time in history. </p>
<p>	For an average Greek that docent know the real situation of Greece might think that this is the 
solution of the problem. The politicians have promised so many things to the people that even if they 
completed a 5 % out of them, the people would be happy. </p>
<p>  But on the other side, the passion of the politicians helping the ones in need has led the cituation of the
country to worsen dramatically. Greece is in the european union and shares the euro currency. Right now, they 
have great need of money that only the European central bank could lend. In order for them to lend money to Greece.The 2nd
one has to sing some agreements with new austerity measures. </p>
<p>  The new government states that they wonâ€™t sing any document
affiliated with austerity measures and that the era that Greece was under 
recession is over. No one knows were they will actually find the money but they are surprisingly positive.</p>
