<p> A web app is a website optimized to be viewed on mobile devices. It can also be accessed from a computer browser but it will look weird and ugly. The advantage of having a web app is that you don’t obligate your user to download the actual application and in the same time offer them a similar experience.</p>
<p>	The first step on creating a web app is to get to know html and css. The fastest and easiest way to learn them is by joining an online learning platform.
