<h2>Everyone starts from somewhere..</h2>

<p>This was my first project. I have invested allot in that website. Not money wise but allot of time. This web site is consisted of several different programming languages. It is written in html,css,javascript and query. Also i have added  some of my non-programming projects. You will be also able to find artwork made by me.</p>
<p>This is the first draft of the web site. Is nothing than over. It needs allot of work and allot of new knowledge. I try to improve myself everyday in order to improve my content for my audience. In the web world that something new is coming up every single day is difficult keep up and definitely to say that a project is complete. You have too update your content all the time if you want too survive the competitiveness. </p>
