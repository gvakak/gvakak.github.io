<h2>Nightmare turned into dream</h2>

<p>Everybody has deep inside him a hidden artist. Some people manage through out their lives to evolve it and become something out of it, and some other like me felt that this artist would never come out. Photoshop was the solution of this problem. It gave me the extra push to bring this artist out. Its unique software lets you do stuff that you couldnâ€™t imagine.But its not easy as it sounds. As everything in life, it need time and effort in order to use it in its full potential. </p>

<p>The first time that i used photoshop was in an image manipulation university class. The first month I war really frustrated because i was feeling that i do not get it. But it comes with time. Now I feel that I own it!</p>
