<h2>Trying something new</h2>
<p>My newest project is an app called PlayGround.Its a way for adults to make it to the â€œplayground" Currently is under construction and I hope that it will be available within the next 3 months. This application is for everyone that plays basketball and soccer. The way it works is very easy. It consists of 3 simple steps. Firstly, you sing in and select what sport you would like to play. Secondly, you are asked too choose between joining or creating a game.Going on, if you choose to join a game you will given different options of games that have been arranged 2 miles within your location. You choose the one you like and after that you are done.You will receive a confirmation mail with all the details. On the other hand, if you create a game. You are entering a listing making it possible for other people to join your game.</p>
<p>It will be a very difficult project to complete and it will upscale my game. I will keep you inform with constant updates. Make sure to subscribe to me email feed in order not to loose any of the action.
